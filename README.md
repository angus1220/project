How to use:

This programme is for the shop owners and waiters to use. It consists of a few parts.
First, the shop owner can input the shop table settings(the numbers of tables of different numbers of seats). Then they can edit the menu with their dishes and their relative prices. These settings are saved into txt files and will be still available when the programme is terminated and run again(in real-life situation, when the shop closes and opens again tomorrow, the settings will still be available)
Then, 11 options will be available for the waiters to manage the restaurant.
Choice 1: Enables the waiters to reset the table information(maybe due to season changes), and the menu.
Choice 2: Enables the waiters to check the availablity of every table.
Choice 3: Enables the waiters to check specifically the fullness of a table.
Choice 4: Enables the waiters to register new customers and assign a customer code to them. The customers are led to a vacant table or instructed to line up in queue
Choice 5: Enables the waiters to check the queue(how many people are waiting, how long have they been waiting)
Choice 6: Enables the waiters to check where a specific group of customers are sitting
Choice 7: Enables the waiters to help take in orders from customers
Choice 8: Enables the waiters to get paid from customers, unoccupy a table and lead customers in the queue to the vacant table if available
Choice 9: Shows the waiters the menu and the dishes' relative prices
Choice 10: Check for tables which are occupied for over one hour
Choice 11: Close the restaurant(Terminating the program)
As a lot of time is wasted for customers waiting the tables for the exact number of seats, or when there are no table sizes for a specific group of customers, different customer groups will sit together.
